Apache httpd 2.4.50 post-mortem
    --> how do you get this version of apache???
Apache documents: multiple/webapps/50383.sh
searchsploit -m 50512 --> remote code execution, from www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50512
searchsploit -m 

--> exploit could be use a bad url and you win!
--> some are great and work w/ great documentation, some are,,,, bad.
--> lots of publically available exploits (old software etc)
 
--> can leave password in file on desktop or just leave stuff around (directory traversals)

- Bad (just leaving things around)
- Passwordublically available exploits (ex apache 2.4.50)
- Is there a way to simulate a person? (requires fooling someone to break in)
    - phishing?
    - XSS
    - CSRF (?)

- Pentesting methodologies:
    - hacker-focused
        - book.hacktricks.xyz
            - there is a page on pentesting methodologies (very helpful!)
        - this gets us to our goal faster :)

    - more industry oriented:
        - OWASP
            - has a guide on how to do a pentest of a website
        - OSSTMM
            - extensive guidelines on how to do a pentest.
        - NIST
        - ISSAF
        -MiTRE Attack


- asset discovery is huge
    - so many data breaches!
