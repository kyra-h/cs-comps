-- Log poisoning
-- Dirty pipe? (2022 bug)
-- make clear how everything chains together
    - 1 attack, now shell as Robert, another attack, now shell as admin, again, now Root

focus more on SQL injection
DB management systems: mysql, postgresql, mariadb, mangodb, etc.
- some allow you to write to the file system w/ a sql command
- some allow you to launch a shell and execute a command w/ SQL

imagine someone doing something like:

$query = 'SELECT * FROM users where name = '$name' and pw = '$pw'";
(stupid, can just use ')

make it easy for SQL to fail, but hard to actually get info

ERR based SQL injection,
    - send err to browser

Timing based attacks;
    - if guessed right, takes a long time to respond (~3s)
    - if guessed wrong, takes milliseconds to respond

Union based attack, blind attack, etc. 



-- could also look into persistence
    - can use systemctl
