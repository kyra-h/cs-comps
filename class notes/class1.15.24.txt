Directory Traversal:
http://---  -  - -/../../ . . . /etc.passwd

Include vs Require


Directory Traversal (lots more files)               Local File inclusion
--> can we retrieve files we shouldn't, can we execute files we shouldnt?

Remote File inclusion
--> Lots more power

File Upload
--> also lots of power

--> Allow treatment of url as file?


/etc/passwd
/etc/shadow
