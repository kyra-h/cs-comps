Class notes Jan 10 2024

- presentation = informal
    - teach class about SQL injections
    - ~ 10 mins long

- HTTP techniques
    - burpsuite proxy: observing & modifying HTTP queries in-flight
    - GET vs POST
    - curl: get requests, post requests, set headers w/ -H, burp w/ --proxy

- apt = interface/package manager similar to homebrew
- Burpsuite & Apt:
    - sudo apt update
    - sudo apt install burpsuite
    - can also do sudo apt upgrade
    - Burpsuite proxy tool is very cool
        - go to browser, turn intercept on
        - click on lock , see where request is too, click off, will switch ports, back to http from https. 
        - http history under proxy tab
        - can change cookies
        - curl http://cs338.jeffondich.com/ -v --proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080/ 
        - goes to burpsuite ! (8080 using burpsuite as a proxy)

- HTTP:
    - POST is typical for form
    - after blank line at bottom, there are a bunch of name:value pairs. This is related to post. Can edit before forwarding. Can teach intruder to try lots of passwords: exactly same post but run through list of passwds. 
    - When a website has a form tag, it is by default going to use the POST verb to retrieve the response. 
    - Data located in the input fields gets included in POST info @ bottom of request. Can get curl to get this info.

- Where are cookies?
    - cd Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome

- php 
<?php  
    $user = $_REQUEST['user'];
    $user2 = $_GET['user'];
    $user3 = $_POST['user];
    echo "hello there, $user/$user2/#user3";
?>
- output goes to client, browser that requested.
- you don't see this code, you see the output... unless.. browser wasn't configured right so you can read people's php. This is bad.
- variables start with $
- can do interpolated strings, with variables in string.
- $_ = superglobal. No matter where you are in php, have access to this variable. (kinda dangerous but ok...)
- js uses object for dictionaries, php calls them arrays


- if I go to the url, say ?user=Jeff in url.
