How passwords work:

user ---(password)----> client ---(password)----> server --H(pw)--> store uname: H(pw)

Better (add random # (salt)): 
server --H(R || pw)--> store uname: R: H(R ||pw)
stored in /etc/shadow

Can run:
hashcat, john the ripper (pw cracking agents, on kali)

/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt


To go deeper:
"process p is running as jondich"
p status? what does it mean to be running as?

what does sudo do? what does setuid do?
