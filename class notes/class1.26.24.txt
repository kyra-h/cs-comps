uname: cs338 pwd: password

new header, Authorization: Baic <base64 encoding of pwd>



/etc/shadow
uname: ??? : 
1 field separated by $
first: what hashing alg

between 2nd $ and /, there is salt

just b/c you can get shadow file, doesn't mean you can get passwd . 


if /etc/password: colons everywhere, look in shadow? 


to make a vulnerability on this system, could change perms on /etc/password/ or /etc/shadow
--> chmod 644 --> 666, could login as whoever, write to /etc/password, write a hash I choose to root line. Then I know password bc i wrote it!

Changing password for root? Or maybe not one already?
