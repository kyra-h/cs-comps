Vulnerabilities we would be interested in including:
- SQL injections
- Cookies 
- File upload attack (Target1)
- cron-related stuff?
- secrets in old git commits (or something like that)
- directory traversal
- things in plain sight
    - just compressed a lot
    - passwords for employees stored in a file w/ salt. 


Some that we could chain together:
- Cookies
    - change cookie to say you're logged in
    - ex. give admin perms?
- Once you're logged in you can see the password file? And can decode the passwords.
