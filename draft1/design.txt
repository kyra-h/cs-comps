Vulnerabilities we would be interested in including:
- SQL injections
- Cookies 
- File upload attack (Target1)
- cron-related stuff?
- secrets in old git commits (or something like that)
- directory traversal
- things in plain sight
    - just compressed a lot
    - passwords for employees stored in a file w/ salt. 
- Abusing sudo perms


Some that we could chain together:
- Cookies
    - change cookie to say you're logged in
    - ex. give admin perms?
- Once you're logged in you can see the password file? And can decode the passwords.


- SQL injection --> logged in as specific user, use SQL injection to search a table?
    - what can we do with only being able to see data. (see table w/ salt and passwd)
    - SQL injection, only can do in url? 

- once logged in as admin group, can update cookies or something to give more perms. 

- update Target1 so you can only upload bad files if you're not an admin
    - clean input if you're not a trusted user. 


Brief description of our machine/who we are:
- Kiyr is a new bakery in town! We are looking for new applications for bakers.
