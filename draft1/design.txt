Vulnerabilities we would be interested in including:
- SQL injections
- Cookies 
- File upload attack (Target1)
- cron-related stuff?
- secrets in old git commits (or something like that)
- directory traversal
- things in plain sight
    - just compressed a lot
    - passwords for employees stored in a file w/ salt. 
- Abusing sudo perms
- Playing around w/ basic auth


Some that we could chain together:
- Cookies
    - change cookie to say you're logged in
    - ex. give admin perms?
- Once you're logged in you can see the password file? And can decode the passwords.


1. SQL injection --> logged in as specific user, use SQL injection to search a table?
    - what can we do with only being able to see data. (see table w/ salt and passwd)
    - SQL injection, only can do in url? 
    - have 1 table that they're actually querying(bread)
    - secret DB of sensitive info (frequent customer acc)

2. once logged in as admin group, can update cookies or something to give more perms. 
    - Or update basic auth
    Once logged in as VIP customer, can do basic auth

3. update Target1 so you can only upload bad files if you're not an admin
    - clean input if you're not a trusted user. 
    - cleans input some if you are (ex removes .php at the end)
