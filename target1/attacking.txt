1. Install VMS (very hard.... lots of converting... bleh)
2. Checking to see what ip they were running on
    nmap 192.168.64.0/24 -p 80  seemed to do it

3. Gobuster the ip I found once I realized it was a web vulnerability
4. Found a file called secret.txt on ManicMeese


Alternatively:
3. Try to login with slab/slab (default password, got root on BlackHoodies)
