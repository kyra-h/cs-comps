Setting up apache:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2
Added html/php files to /var/www/html
- Inside the html there was a form in which someone could upload a file
- no error checking for what type of file, thus people can upload any php code that will get executed by the server
Getting apache to run on boot:
Added to sudovi
%cslab ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
%slab ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
cslab ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
slab ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
Added to bash.bashrc
sudo systemctl start apache2
Made sure that files went to the right directory.
